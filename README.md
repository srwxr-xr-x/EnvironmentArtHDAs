# Environment Art HDAs

## About
EnvironmentArtHDAs is a digital asset library for SideFX's *Houdini* meant for use by.. Environment Artists! These are my own HDA's that are fully documented that I use for my own personal projects.
This repository is **open source software**! Free to use by anyone, forever!

## Tools

- **Cumulonimbus Generator**
  - Generate photorealistic *Cumulonimbus Capillatus* clouds with VDBs
  
- **Nanitify**
  -  Cut up massive meshes into smaller objects UV centered to the origin to allow for importing into Unreal Engine without crashes. Automatically Nanite enabled, and with support with Houdini Engine for Unreal.
 
- **Trunk Meshing**
  - Take a skeleton or L-System and mesh it with realistic wood veins, highly customizable and fast for any usecase. Best paired with a tool that generates skeletons like [Natsura](https://www.natsura.com).

## Installation
Since all HDAs are built for sharing, all you need to do to install them is navigate to `File->Import->Houdini Digital Asset...` and navigate to the HDA you wish to use!

## Further Resources
